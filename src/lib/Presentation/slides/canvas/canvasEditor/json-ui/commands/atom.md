**What is an Atom**

Atoms are the building blocks of all matter. Every substance, whether solid, liquid, or gas, is composed of atoms. These atoms combine in various ways to form the vast array of materials and objects we see around us every day.

**Basic Concept of an Atom**

- An atom is the smallest unit of matter that retains the properties of an element.
- Everything around us is made up of atoms, from the air we breathe to the food we eat, and even our own bodies.
- Atoms are incredibly small, scientists use powerful tools like electron microscopes to observe them.

**Structure of an Atom**

An atom consists of three main particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. The central part of the atom is called the nucleus, which contains protons and neutrons. Protons carry a positive charge, while neutrons have no charge, making the nucleus positively charged overall. Surrounding the nucleus are electrons, which are negatively charged particles that move in orbitals.

The nucleus is the dense center of the atom where most of its mass resides. Electrons, which are much lighter than protons and neutrons, move rapidly around the nucleus in regions called electron shells or orbitals.

**Comparison Between the Structure of the Solar System and an Atom**

Interestingly, the structure of an atom can be compared to a miniature solar system. Just as planets orbit the sun, electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom. However, unlike planets, electrons do not follow fixed paths but rather exist in regions of probability called orbitals.

**Atomic Mass**

Atomic mass reflects the mass of both protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom, as electrons contribute negligibly to the overall mass. The atomic mass of an element is essentially the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons in its atoms. Because the mass of electrons is so small, it does not significantly affect the overall atomic mass.

**Electron Orbits and Energy Levels**

Electrons move around the nucleus in specific regions called energy levels or shells. Each shell can hold a certain number of electrons:

- The first shell can hold up to 2 electrons.
- The second shell can hold up to 8 electrons.
- The third shell can hold up to 18 electrons, and so on.
- The pattern is determined by the formula 2n^2
Electrons fill the lowest energy levels first. When an electron moves to a higher energy level, it absorbs energy. When it drops back to a lower energy level, it releases energy.


**Examples of Some Element Atoms and Their Structure**

- **Hydrogen (H)**: The simplest atom, consisting of one proton and one electron. It has no neutrons.
- **Helium (He)**: Contains two protons, two neutrons, and two electrons. Its electrons are in a single shell.
- **Carbon (C)**: Has six protons, six neutrons, and six electrons. Its electrons are arranged in two shells, with two in the first shell and four in the second.
- **Oxygen (O)**: Contains eight protons, eight neutrons, and eight electrons. The electrons are in two shells, with two in the first shell and six in the second.
